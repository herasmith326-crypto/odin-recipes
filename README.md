# Odin Recipes
This is my first HTML project called Odin Recipes.
In this project, I applied the HTML skills I have learned to create a simple recipe website. The website includes a main index page with links to individual recipe pages, each containing images, descriptions, ingredients, and steps to prepare the dish.
 I really enjoyed making this project .
