# Odin Recipes
This is my first HTML project called Odin Recipes.
In this project, I applied the HTML skills I have learned to create a simple recipe website. The website includes a main index page with links to individual recipe pages, each containing images, descriptions, ingredients, and steps to prepare the dish.

Lessons Applied

While creating this project, I applied the following skills from The Odin Project:
HTML Structure & Boilerplate: Creating proper HTML documents with <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.
Headings & Paragraphs: Using <h1>, <h2>, <p> to organize content.
Links: Creating internal links between pages with <a href="...">.
Lsts: Using <ul> for ingredients and <ol> for steps.
Images: Adding images with <img> tags and alt text.
Folders & File Organization: Organizing files with a recipes folder inside the main project directory.
Navigation: Adding links back to the homepage for easy user navigation.
Publishing with GitHub Pages: Making the project accessible on the web.
 
 I really enjoyed making this project .
